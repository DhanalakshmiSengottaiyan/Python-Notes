# Python-Notes
**Jupiter Notebook Basics:**
**Installation and Execution:**
Install Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupiter Notebook.
Open Desktop folder and create your new Python file by clicking the Python3(ipykernel).
Save the file with .py extension.Extension of Jupiter notebook .ipynb (Integrated Python Notebook).
Codes are executed inside the cell using RUN button or shift+enter.
Keyboard shortcuts: shift+A -->insert cell above
                    shift+B -->insert cell below
2 types of cell:
1.Coding cell: A place to write the code.
2.Markdown Cell: Can write anything but treated as a form of text
Markdown concepts: Insert # (max 4 #) treated as Heading; 5#'s changes in the style of heading
                   Insert numbers,* or - followed by a space. It is treated as pointers.

3 methods of Execution of Python file:
Method 1: Jupiter Notebook (as mentioned above)
Method 2: Python Interpretor
Method 3: A python file and running through a terminal.

Python Interpretor: Click Terminal inside the Desktop folder;
                    Command window is displayed. Enter Python and write the code and execute it. use exit(),quit() to close the terminal.

Python file (text file with .py) and a terminal: To access the python file from the terminal, we use Linux commands.Some basic commands are:
                                                pwd:Present Working Directory
                                                ls: list all files and folders in current directory
                                                cd : change directory (cd folder name);to pass folder name with spaces use cd 'folder name';
                                                cd ..: to come one -step back: previous step;
                                                We use cd followed by the path to access the file.Once this is reached use the format python followed by the file name with extension.
                                                Output of the code will get displayed.
